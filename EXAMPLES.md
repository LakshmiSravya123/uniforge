- List 10+ features

### Examples:

**Good:**
```
"Expense tracker with categories and monthly reports"
"Recipe manager with ingredient search"
"Todo list with due dates and priorities"
```

**Too Vague:**
```
"An app for managing stuff"
"Something to track things"
"A helpful tool"
```

**Too Complex:**
```
"A fully featured enterprise CRM with AI predictions, blockchain integration, real-time collaboration, advanced analytics, and mobile apps"
```
