## 🔥 What Makes This Special

### Honest About Limitations
- ❌ Cannot deploy for you (no access to your accounts)
- ❌ Cannot create "live URLs" without your credentials
- ✅ Tells you EXACTLY what to do instead
- ✅ Provides all code and configs needed

### Actually Works
- ✅ Run locally in seconds
- ✅ All dependencies managed
- ✅ Clean, readable code
- ✅ Production-ready patterns
- ✅ Proper error handling

### Better Than Promises
Instead of saying "deployed" when it's not:
1. Generates complete, working code
2. Runs locally immediately
3. Gives exact deploy steps
4. You deploy with your accounts
5. Takes ~5 minutes total

## 🎯 Test It Right Now

```bash
# Go to UniForge directory
cd /Users/sravyalu/uniforge

# Generate an app
python codeforge.py "Movie watchlist with ratings"

# Run it locally
cd generated/moviewatchlist
bash ../quickstart.sh

# See it at http://localhost:5173
```
